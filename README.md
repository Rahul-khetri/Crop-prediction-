# 🌾 Crop Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts the **most suitable crop** for cultivation based on soil and environmental parameters such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.  
It uses **Python** and **Machine Learning algorithms** to help farmers and agricultural planners make data-driven decisions for better yield and resource utilization.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Agriculture plays a vital role in the economy, and choosing the right crop for specific conditions can significantly improve productivity.  
This project uses **supervised machine learning** techniques to predict the best crop to grow in a given region based on input data.

(Optional) Flask web interface for easy user input

🧠 Tech Stack

Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Framework (Optional): Flask

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset typically includes the following parameters:

Feature	Description
N	Nitrogen content in soil
P	Phosphorus content in soil
K	Potassium content in soil
temperature	Average temperature (°C)
humidity	Relative humidity (%)
ph	pH value of the soil
rainfall	Average rainfall (mm)
label	Recommended crop

(You can adjust the table based on your actual dataset.)
